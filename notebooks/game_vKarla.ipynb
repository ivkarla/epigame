        "##### The first version had several problems.\n",
        "#####    - The strategy implementation (av_choice, mm_choice) was a derivative of the original strategy (average, MM)\n",
        "#####    - The turns were repeats for all strategies, except the random strategy\n",
        "##### In this game, the players are random groups of nodes, which makes it the game of neworks. The size of a random subnet is a fraction of the total node number (implanted iEEG channels; e.g., 0.1X). The number of players is also dependant on the total node number (e.g., 5X). \n",

        "##### The card selection is RANDOM. Why? Because the game is NOT a simulation of the connectivity dynamics that happend under the hood of the EEG signal. The game is an analysis tool, that merely identifies the groups that change their connectivity the most. \n",
